Hi. I'm a software engineer. I'm also interested in deep learning, natural language processing, and neuroscience.

My long-term goal is to become an AI researcher and improve upon models' ability to think and generalize like humans. I plan to approach this by understanding and improving upon the reasoning capabilities of large language models, exploring to what extent they can reason through complex tasks and achieve a human-like level of understanding.

I'm also interested in mechanistic interpretability. By studying the internal structure of models, we can understand how specific concepts and reasoning steps are represented within a neural network. This can provide insight into the depth and limitations of a model's comprehension.
