How to learn large amounts of information
- Active learning / Notes
    - actively understanding what you're writing and not just copying notes from board
- First person
    - try to put things into your own life
- Metacognition
    - know what you know and what you don't know
- Rule of 1/2s
    - review slides after day 1, day 2, day 4, day 8, etc.

### Memory Systems

Long Term Memory

1. Declarative - Explicit
- consists of words, meanings, facts, general knowledge
- we often don't know where or when we acquired this knowledge, but it is vital for comprehension

2. Nondeclarative - Implicit
- Procedural - motor skills, habits, unconsciously learned rules -> repetition leads to changes in the striatum

Priming - unconscious activation of long term memory by sensory input, affecting conscious perception and thought, keeps us thinking along logical lines -> neocortex (frontal)

Spreading-activation model: proposes that the activation of any one concept initiates a spread of activity to nearby concepts in the network, which primes those concepts so they become temporarily more retrievable than they were before.

### LTP and Serendipity


Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process involving persistent strengthening of synapses that leads to a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between neurons. It is an important process in the context of synaptic plasticity. LTP recording is widely recognized as a cellular model for the study of memory.

LTP is like a marriage bond, connections are stronger between the presynpatic and postsynaptic neurons.

Long Term Potentiation - the biomolecular process that your neurons go through as you learn
- how connections between neurons are strengthened through repeated pairing/firing
- neurons that fire together, wire together (using LTP)
    - our brain cells communicate with one another via synaptic transmission - one brain cell releases a chemical (neurotransmitter) that the next brain cell absorbs. This communication process is known as "neuronal firing." When brain cells communicate frequently, the connection between them strengthens. Messages that travel the same pathway in the brain over & over begin to transmit faster and faster. With enough repetition, they become automatic. That's why we practice things like hitting a golf ball - with enough practice, we can go on automatic pilot.

A dendritic spine is a small membranous profusion from a neuron's dendrite that typically receives input from a single axon at the synapse.

The more the spines are stimulated, the bigger, more stable, and longer lived they become (in contrast with smaller, immature spines, which are more transient).
These large, so-called mushroom or stubby spines are thought to be one of the physical correlates of memory.

Repeated long-term potentiation causes spines to become larger and heartier.

In 2014, a study found that after mice ran forward on a rod, their layer V neurons formed new spines on some dendritic branches, but not others (these so-called learning-induced spines are correlated with long-term motor skill retention). If the mice ran forward on the rod again, they tended to form more spines on the same branches. If they ran backward, they formed new spines, but on different branches.

Some of the mice were kept awake for several hours after they ran, while others were allowed to sleep. In the brains of the mice who slept, the same neurons that had fired while the mice were running started firing again during sleep. Ultimately, the mice who slept formed spines that were longer lasting and more numerous than those formed by their sleep-deprived peers.


Synapses are strengthened and maintained in stages:
Changes in synaptic strength that support LTP evolve in stages that can be identified by the unique molecular processes that support each stage.

Lasting synaptic changes depend on a temporally ordered sequence of molecular events
- Generation, Stabilization, Consolidation, Maintenance

How do we create permanent memories through this system?
- the synaptic molecules that support memory are very short lived compared to the duration of our memories
- so how is memory stored?
- occasional activation signals a host of maintenance molecular processes -->
